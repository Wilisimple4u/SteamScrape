The idea was to at least make a code that could scrape infromation off of Steam's search finding games on discount. 
Where I would then move that infromation to my own website.

# TODO

Things I want to try and add to my Steam Scrape project README:
- [x] Pictures
- [ ] Code segments/highlights
- [ ] Tags
- [ ] Highligted sections
- [x] Checkboxes/bulletpointlist
- [ ] Links, is it as simple as copy paste?
